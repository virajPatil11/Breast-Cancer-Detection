This repository is having all the codes  for making Breast Cancer Detection.

## What's inside the dataset ?

## There are two types of tumors:-

1) Banign : Not Cancers
2) Malignant : Cancers

And 569 samples of tumors

I have divided the datasets in three following:
1) 500 samples for testing.
2) 35 samples for training

For first 10 samples i have analyzed the predicted values and actual value.
